# Vagrant for Devloping Ruby on Rails and React within Coder Academy

## Installation

First you will need to install virtual machine software such as **VirtualBox** or **VmWare Player**. This will be used to host a virtual Ubuntu virtual machine for developing on.

Then install Vagrant https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html. This allows us to automatically customise the virtual machine so that it has all the software we need.

Download this repository, make sure you are in the same folder as 'Vagrantfile'in terminal (MacOS/Linux) or Powershell (Windows).

| Command             | Action                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `vagrant up`        | Creates the machine               |
| `vagrant ssh`       | Connects to the machine via ssh   |
| `vagrant destroy`   | Deletes the machine               |

Remember you must be in the same folder as the `Vagrantfile` in order to run it.
